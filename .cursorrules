# Code Quality Rules

## Remove Unnecessary Code

Always remove unnecessary code before committing. This includes:

1. **Unused variables, functions, and attributes**: Remove any code that is defined but never used, including:
   - Data attributes that are set but never read
   - Inline scripts that duplicate functionality already provided by localized scripts
   - Variables or functions that are declared but never called

2. **Code that cannot execute**: Remove code that will never run due to context limitations:
   - WordPress Customizer API code (`wp.customize`) on non-customizer screens (e.g., post edit screens)
   - Event listeners for APIs that aren't available in the current context
   - Conditional code where the condition can never be true

3. **Unnecessary dependencies**: Remove script/style dependencies that aren't actually used:
   - Don't include `customize-controls` dependency unless actually using the Customizer API
   - Only include dependencies that are directly used in the code

4. **Redundant functionality**: If functionality is already provided elsewhere, don't duplicate it:
   - If colors are set inline via `style` attributes, don't also set them via JavaScript unless needed for dynamic updates
   - If data is already localized via `wp_localize_script`, don't also output it in inline scripts

5. **Dead code paths**: Remove code in else/elseif branches that will never execute, or simplify conditionals that are always true/false.

Before finalizing code, review it to ensure every line serves a purpose and will execute in the intended context.

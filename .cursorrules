# Code Quality Rules

## Remove Unnecessary Code

Always remove unnecessary code before committing. This includes:

1. **Unused variables, functions, and attributes**: Remove any code that is defined but never used, including:
  - Data attributes that are set but never read
  - Inline scripts that duplicate functionality already provided by localized scripts
  - Variables or functions that are declared but never called

2. **Code that cannot execute**: Remove code that will never run due to context limitations:
  - WordPress Customizer API code (`wp.customize`) on non-customizer screens (e.g., post edit screens)
  - Event listeners for APIs that aren't available in the current context
  - Conditional code where the condition can never be true

3. **Unnecessary dependencies**: Remove script/style dependencies that aren't actually used:
  - Don't include `customize-controls` dependency unless actually using the Customizer API
  - Only include dependencies that are directly used in the code

4. **Redundant functionality**: If functionality is already provided elsewhere, don't duplicate it:
  - If colors are set inline via `style` attributes, don't also set them via JavaScript unless needed for dynamic updates
  - If data is already localized via `wp_localize_script`, don't also output it in inline scripts

5. **Dead code paths**: Remove code in else/elseif branches that will never execute, or simplify conditionals that are always true/false.

Before finalizing code, review it to ensure every line serves a purpose and will execute in the intended context.

## JavaScript Syntax

**Do not use JSX syntax** in JavaScript files. This theme does not use a build process to transpile JSX. Instead, use `wp.element.createElement()` for creating React elements in WordPress block editor scripts. JSX syntax will cause syntax errors since the browser cannot parse it directly.

## Formatting

Comments:
  - In comments, add a period at the end only if it's a sentence.
  - **Always add an empty line above comments that are on their own line or in a comment block.** This includes:
    - Single-line comments (`//`) that are on their own line
    - Multi-line comment blocks (`/** */`)
    - Comments that appear at the start of a function, method, or code block
    - The only exception is comments that appear on the same line as code (inline comments)

Spacing:
  - Use spaces to line up assignments in arrays.
  - Don't line up variable assignments outside of arrays.
  - **Don't align parameters in PHPDoc blocks.** Use a single space after the type and parameter name, then the description. For example:
    - ✅ `@param array $args Block type arguments`
    - ❌ `@param array  $args Block type arguments` (extra spaces for alignment)
